# Overview
Mysto_blockdoubleclutch is a simple script that prevents players from abusing the double clutch functionality built into GTA V. Please read up on what double clutching is and how it skips gears and boosts acceleration of vehicles. This resource will entirely prevent it. The code is open-source and can be edited at any time as preferable.
